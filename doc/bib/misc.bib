  abstract  = "Protein identification and analysis software performs a central
               role in the investigation of proteins from two-dimensional (2-D)
               gels and mass spectrometry. For protein identification, the user
               matches certain empirically acquired information against a
               protein database to define a protein as already known or as
               novel. For protein analysis, information in protein databases
               can be used to predict certain properties about a protein, which
               can be useful for its empirical investigation. The two processes
               are thus complementary. Although there are numerous programs
               available for those applications, we have developed a set of
               original tools with a few main goals in mind. Specifically,
               these are:1.To utilize the extensive annotation available in the
               Swiss-Prot database (1) wherever possible, in particular the
               position-specific annotation in the Swiss-Prot feature tables to
               take into account posttranslational modifications and protein
               processing.2.To develop tools specifically, but not exclusively,
               applicable to proteins prepared by twodimensional gel
               electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting experiments.3.To
               make all tools available on the World-Wide Web (WWW), and freely
               usable by the scientific community.",

  author    = "Beitz, Eric",
  abstract  = "Motivation: Typesetting, shading and labeling of nucleotide and
               peptide alignments using standard word processing or graphics
               software is time consuming. Available automatic sequence shading
               programs usually do not allow manual application of additional
               shadings or labels. Hence, a flexible alignment shading package
               was designed for both calculated and manual shading, using the
               macro language of the scientific typesetting software
               LaTeX2e.Results: TeXshade is the first TeX-based alignment
               shading software featuring, in addition to standard identity and
               similarity shading, special modes for the display of functional
               aspects such as charge, hydropathy or solvent accessibility. A
               plenitude of commands for manual shading, graphical labels,
               re-arrangements of the sequence order, numbering, legends etc.
               is implemented. Further, TeXshade allows the inclusion and
               display of secondary structure predictions in the DSSP-, STRIDE-
               and PHD-format.Availability: From
