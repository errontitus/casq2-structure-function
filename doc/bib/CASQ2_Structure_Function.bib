  abstract  = "The sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) is the main
               intracellular calcium (Ca2+) pool in muscle and non-muscle
               eukaryotic cells, respectively. The reticulum accumulates Ca2+
               against its electrochemical gradient by the action of
               sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA pumps), and
               the capacity of this Ca2+ store is increased by the presence of
               Ca2+ binding proteins in the lumen of the reticulum. A diversity
               of physical and chemical signals, activate the main Ca2+ release
               channels, i.e. ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol (1, 4, 5)
               trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), to produce transient elevations
               of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) while the
               reticulum is being depleted of Ca2+. This picture is incomplete
               because it implies that the elements involved in the Ca2+
               release process are acting alone and independently of each
               other. However, it appears that the Ca2+ released by RyRs and
               IP3Rs is trapped in luminal Ca2+ binding proteins (Ca2+
               lattice), which are associated with these release channels, and
               the activation of these channels appears to facilitate that the
               trapped Ca2+ ions become available for release. This situation
               makes the initial stage of the Ca2+ release process a highly
               efficient one; accordingly, there is a large increase in the
               [Ca2+]i with minimal reductions in the bulk of the free luminal
               SR/ER [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]SR/ER). Additionally, it has been shown that
               active SERCA pumps are required for attaining this highly
               efficient Ca2+ release process. All these data indicate that
               Ca2+ release by the SR/ER is a highly regulated event and not
               just Ca2+ coming down its electrochemical gradient via the open
               release channels. One obvious advantage of this sophisticated
               Ca2+ release process is to avoid depletion of the ER Ca2+ store
               and accordingly, to prevent the activation of ER stress during
               each Ca2+ release event.",

              the work of Pauling et al.1 on polypeptide conformation, which

              found in the structures of small molecules. Thus we can learn
              much about weak interactions in proteins by analysing small
              molecule crystal structures. Here we comment on the existence of
              hydrogen bonds between two carboxyl groups, forming what amounts
              to the acid salts of monobasic carboxylic acids. We believe these

              protein crystals and multi-subunit complexes at low pH than has

              characterization of the thermodynamics of their association.
              Historically it has been virtually impossible to experimentally
              estimate changes in protein conformational entropy, a potentially
              important component of the free energy of protein association.
              However, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has emerged as a
              powerful tool for characterizing the dynamics of proteins. Here
              we employ changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for
              corresponding changes in conformational entropy. We find that the
              change in internal dynamics of the protein calmodulin varies
              significantly on binding a variety of target domains.
              Surprisingly, the apparent change in the corresponding

  abstract = "Calcium carries messages to virtually all important functions of
              cells. Although it was already active in unicellular organisms,
              its role became universally important after the transition to
              multicellular life. In this Minireview, we explore how calcium
              ended up in this privileged position. Most likely its unique
              coordination chemistry was a decisive factor as it makes its
              binding by complex molecules particularly easy even in the
              presence of large excesses of other cations, e.g. magnesium. Its
              free concentration within cells can thus be maintained at the
              very low levels demanded by the signaling function. A large cadre
              of proteins has evolved to bind or transport calcium. They all
              contribute to buffer it within cells, but a number of them also
              decode its message for the benefit of the target. The most
              important of these ``calcium sensors'' are the EF-hand proteins.
              Calcium is an ambivalent messenger. Although essential to the
              correct functioning of cell processes, if not carefully
              controlled spatially and temporally within cells, it generates

              an essential role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, signalling,
              cell differentiation and muscle contractility. During SR Ca2+
              uptake and release, proton fluxes are required to balance the
              charge deficit generated by the exchange of Ca2+ and other ions
              across the SR. During Ca2+ uptake by the SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA),
              two protons are countertransported from the SR lumen to the
              cytosol, thus partially compensating for the charge moved by Ca2+

              into the SR lumen during SERCA inhibition by endogenous

              deficiency to the arrhythmia phenotype is difficult to assess
              because Casq2-/- mice also show significant reductions in the

              buffering SR luminal Ca2+. To address both questions, we examined
              heterozygous (Casq2+/-) mice, which have a 25\% reduction in
              Casq2 but no significant decrease in other SR proteins. Casq2+/-
              mice (n=35) challenged with isoproterenol displayed 3-fold higher
              rates of ventricular ectopy than Casq2+/+ mice (n=31; P<0.05).
              Programmed stimulation induced significantly more ventricular
              tachycardia in Casq2+/- mice than in Casq2+/+ mice.
              Field-stimulated Ca2+ transients, cell shortening, L-type Ca2+

              isoproterenol, SR Ca2+ leak was significantly increased in
              Casq2+/- myocytes (Casq2+/- 0.18+/-0.02 F(ratio) versus Casq2+/+
              0.11+/-0.01 F(ratio), n=57, 60; P<0.01), resulting in a
              significantly higher rate of spontaneous SR Ca2+ releases and
              triggered beats. SR luminal Ca2+ measured using Mag-Fura-2 was
              not altered by Casq2 reduction. As a result, the relationship
              between SR Ca2+ leak and SR luminal Ca2+ was significantly
              different between Casq2+/- and Casq2+/+ myocytes (P<0.01). Thus,
              even modest reductions in Casq2 increase SR Ca2+ leak and cause
              ventricular tachycardia susceptibility under stress. The
              underlying mechanism is likely the direct regulation of SR Ca2+

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A point mutation in human cardiac calsequestrin
              (CSQ-D307H) is responsible for a form of polymorphic ventricular
              tachycardia (PVT). When overexpressed in heart cells, the mutated
              CSQ leads to diminished Ca(2+) transients, consistent with
              defective regulation of intralumenal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
              Ca(2+). METHODS: To analyze the D307H mutant and determine
              whether the D307H mutation results in loss of normal
              protein-protein interactions, we prepared recombinant human
              wild-type (WT) and D307H forms of CSQ in mammalian cells.
              RESULTS: Although we found the two proteins to undergo similar
              glycosylation and phosphorylation, we discovered that
              Ca(2+)-dependent binding of the D307H mutant to both triadin-1
              and junctin was reduced by greater than 50\% compared to WT.
              Reduced binding of the D307H mutant CSQ to target proteins was
              similar throughout a complete range of Ca(2+) concentrations. To
              investigate the mechanism of reduced Ca(2+)-dependent binding,
              Ca(2+)-dependent changes in intrinsic fluorescence emission for
              the two protein forms were compared. Intrinsic fluorescence of
              the D307H mutant was highly reduced, reflecting significant
              alteration in the tertiary protein structure. Moreover, the
              changes in fluorescence caused by increasing the Ca(2+)
              concentration were very significantly blunted, indicating that
              the Ca(2+)-dependent conformational change was virtually lost.
              CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the point mutation D307H leads to a
              profoundly altered conformation that no longer responds normally
              to Ca(2+) and fails to bind normally to triadin and junctin.",

              In this study, we found that introduction of CASQ2(D307H) protein

              CASQ2(D307H) myocytes, when rhythmically paced and challenged

              that CASQ2(D307H) point mutation may affect Ca(2+) buffering

              A structural model that predicts linear CSQ polymers has been
              developed that might explain CSQ concentration and localization
              inside junctional SR lumens, however little evidence exists for

              efficiently retained within the ER, but its retention is lost
              under conditions expected to disrupt its polymerization. In the

              co-localization with cardCSQ in COS cells or in rat neonatal
              heart cells, but instead concentrates in a membrane compartment
              (ERGIC) that is just distal to that of cardCSQ. Consistent with
              this difference in immunofluorescent localization, the structures
              of CSQ ((316)Asn-linked) glycans showed two types of pre-Golgi

              storage of Ca2+ and in excitation-contraction coupling of
              skeletal muscles. CS is synthesized in the ER (endoplasmic
              reticulum) and is targeted to the TC (terminal cisternae) of SR
              via mechanisms still largely unknown, but probably involving
              vesicle transport through the Golgi complex. In the present
              study, two mutant forms of Sar1 and ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor
              1) were used to disrupt cargo exit from ER-exit sites and
              intra-Golgi trafficking in skeletal-muscle fibres respectively.
              Co-expression of Sar1-H79G (His79-->Gly) and recombinant,
              epitope-tagged CS, CSHA1 (where HA1 stands for nine-amino-acid
              epitope of the viral haemagglutinin 1), barred segregation of
              CSHA1 to TC. On the other hand, expression of ARF1-N126I altered
              the subcellular localization of GM130, a cis -medial Golgi
              protein in skeletal-muscle fibres and myotubes, without
              interfering with CSHA1 targeting to either TC or developing SR.
              Thus active budding from ER-exit sites appears to be involved in
              CS targeting and routing, but these processes are insensitive to
              modification of intracellular vesicle trafficking and Golgi
              complex disruption caused by the mutant ARF1-N126I. It also
              appears that CS routing from ER to SR does not involve classical

              the role of triadin using mice with ablation of the Trdn gene
              (Trdn(-/-)). The structure and protein composition of the cardiac

              (RyR2, Casq2, junctin, and junctophilin 1 and 2) are
              significantly reduced in Trdn(-/-) hearts, whereas Cav1.2 and

              and an overall 50\% reduction in the contacts between jSR and

              of Cav1.2 with RyR2 and substantial Casq2 labeling outside of the

              Uninhibited Ca(2+) influx via I(Ca) likely contributes to Ca(2+)

              proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), including the
              calcium-binding protein calsequestrin (CSQ), the ryanodine
              receptor (RyR) calcium release channel, and skeletal triadin 95
              kDa (trisk95) and junctin, proteins that bind to calsequestrin
              type 1 (CSQ1) and ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). CSQ1 inhibits
              RyR1 and communicates store calcium load to RyR1 channels via
              trisk95 and/or junctin. METHODS: In this manuscript, we test
              predictions that CSQ1's acidic C-terminus contains binding sites
              for trisk95 and junctin, the major calcium binding domain, and
              that it determines CSQ1's ability to regulate RyR1 activity.
              RESULTS: Progressive alanine substitution of C-terminal acidic
              residues of CSQ1 caused a parallel reduction in the calcium
              binding capacity but did not significantly alter CSQ1's
              association with trisk95/junctin or influence its inhibition of
              RyR1 activity. Deletion of the final seven residues in the
              C-terminus significantly hampered calcium binding, significantly
              reduced CSQ's association with trisk95/junctin and decreased its
              inhibition of RyR1. Deletion of the full C-terminus further
              reduced calcium binding to CSQ1 altered its association with
              trisk95 and junctin and abolished its inhibition of RyR1.
              CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the number of residues
              mutated/deleted and binding of calcium, trisk95, and junctin
              suggests that binding of each depends on diffuse ionic
              interactions with several C-terminal residues and that these
              interactions may be required for CSQ1 to maintain normal muscle

              0.79 mM were titrated in the absence, and 23 sites with a KD of
              0.88 mM in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+. No cooperativity was
              observed. For Mg2+ binding, the combination of gel filtration and
              microcalorimetry yielded a stoichiometry of 26 Mg2+/protein with
              a KD of 2mM. 1 mM Ca2+ decreased the stoichiometry to 20
              Mg2+/protein. Binding of Ca2+ in the absence and presence of 3 mM
              Mg2+ was accompanied by a release of 2.0 and 2.7 H+/protein,
              respectively. Mg2+ binding did not lead to a significant proton
              release suggesting a qualitative difference in the Ca(2+)- and
              Mg(2+)-binding sites. After correction for proton release, the
              enthalpy change for Ca2+ binding was very low (-1.5 kJ/protein in
              the absence, and -15 kJ/protein in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+).
              The entropy change (+59 J/K.site in the absence and +56 J/K.site
              in the presence of Mg2+) was therefore virtually the sole driving
              force for Ca2+ binding. Mg2+ binding is slightly more exothermic
              (-12.6 kJ/protein), but as for Ca2+, the entropy change (+50
              J/K.site) constituted the major driving force of the reaction. A
              fluorimetric study indicates that the conformation of tryptophan
              in Mg(2+)-saturated calsequestrin was clearly different from that
              in the Ca(2+)-saturated protein, but that the (Ca2+ +
              Mg2+)-saturated protein was not distinct from the
              Ca(2+)-saturated protein. Thus, in addition to the thermodynamic
              characterization of the Ca2+/calsequestrin interaction, our data
              indicate that Ca2+ and Mg2+ do not bind to the same sites on
              calsequestrin. The data also predict considerable proton fluxes

              CSQ retention within the ER can be dissociated from condensation,

              membrane. We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of
              this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and
              is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in
              cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Jones, L. R., Zhang, L.,

              Chem. 270, 30787-30796). In the present study, we have examined
              the binding interactions between the cardiac forms of these four
              proteins with emphasis placed on the role of junctin. By a
              combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity
              chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and
              fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds
              directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor.
              This binding interaction is localized to the lumenal domain of
              junctin, which is highly enriched in charged amino acids
              organized into ``KEKE'' motifs. KEKE repeats are also found in
              the common lumenal domain of triadin, which likewise is capable
              of binding to calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (Guo, W.,

              appears that junctin and triadin interact directly in the
              junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and stabilize a
              complex that anchors calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor.
              Taken together, these results suggest that junctin,
              calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a
              quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of

              junctional domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) that bear
              calcium release channels, also called ryanodine receptors (RyRs).
              In cardiac muscle, CRUs come in three subtypes that differ in
              geometry, but have common molecular components. Peripheral
              couplings are formed by a junction of the jSR with the
              plasmalemma; dyads occur where the jSR is associated with
              transverse (T)-tubules; corbular SR is a jSR domain that is
              located within the cells and bears RyRs but does not associate
              with either plasmalemma or T-tubules. Using transmission electron
              microscopy, this study followed the formation of CRUs and their
              accrual of four components: the L-type channel dihydropyridine
              receptors (DHPRs) of plasmalemma/T-tubules; the RyRs of jSR;
              triadin (Tr) and junctin (JnC), two homologous components of the

              binding proteins. During differentiation, peripheral couplings
              are formed first and the others follow. RyRs and DHPRs are
              targeted to subdomains of the CRUs that face each other and are
              acquired in a concerted manner. Overexpressions of either

              by Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through the
              interactions of proteins forming the Ca(2+) release unit (CRU).
              Among them, calsequestrin (CSQ) and histidine-rich Ca(2+) binding
              protein (HRC) are known to bind the charged luminal region of
              triadin (TRN) and thus directly or indirectly regulate ryanodine
              receptor 2 (RyR2) activity. However, the mechanisms of CSQ and
              HRC mediated regulation of RyR2 activity through TRN have
              remained unclear. We first examined the minimal KEKE motif of TRN
              involved in the interactions with CSQ2, HRC and RyR2 using TRN
              deletion mutants and in vitro binding assays. The results showed
              that CSQ2, HRC and RyR2 share the same KEKE motif region on the
              distal part of TRN (aa 202-231). Second, in vitro binding assays
              were conducted to examine the Ca(2+) dependence of
              protein-protein interactions (PPI). The results showed that
              TRN-HRC interaction had a bell-shaped Ca(2+) dependence, which
              peaked at pCa4, whereas TRN-CSQ2 or TRN-RyR2 interaction did not
              show such Ca(2+) dependence pattern. Third, competitive binding
              was conducted to examine whether CSQ2, HRC, or RyR2 affects the
              TRN-HRC or TRN-CSQ2 binding at pCa4. Among them, only CSQ2 or
              RyR2 competitively inhibited TRN-HRC binding, suggesting that HRC
              can confer functional refractoriness to CRU, which could be

              protein (HRC) are sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-binding proteins
              that regulate SR Ca release in mammalian heart. Deletion of
              either CASQ2 or HRC results in relatively mild phenotypes
              characterized by preserved cardiac structure and function,
              although CASQ2 knockout (KO), or Cnull, shows increased
              arrhythmia burden under conditions of catecholaminergic stress.
              We hypothesized that given the apparent overlap of functions of
              CASQ2 and HRC, simultaneous ablation of both would deteriorate
              the cardiac phenotype compared with the single knockouts. METHODS
              AND RESULTS: In contrast to this expectation, double knockout
              (DKO) mice lacking both CASQ2 and HRC exhibited normal cardiac
              ejection fraction and ultrastructure. Moreover, the
              predisposition to catecholamine-dependent arrhythmia that
              characterizes the Cnull phenotype was alleviated in the DKO mice.
              At the myocyte level, DKO mice displayed Ca transients of normal
              amplitude; additionally, the frequency of spontaneous Ca waves
              and sparks in the presence of isoproterenol were decreased
              markedly compared with Cnull. Furthermore, restitution of SR Ca
              release was slowed in DKO myocytes compared with Cnull cells.
              CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that rather than being
              functionally redundant, CASQ2 and HRC modulate cardiac ryanodine
              receptor-mediated (RyR2) Ca release in an opposing manner. In
              particular, while CASQ2 stabilizes RyR2 rendering it refractory

              RyR2 recovery from refractoriness.",

              polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly

              muscle SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum); however, it is unknown
              whether Ca2+ binding to CASQ2 is due to its location inside the
              SR rich in Ca2+ or due to its preference for Ca2+ over other
              ions. Therefore a major aim of the present study was to determine
              how CASQ2 selects Ca2+ over other metal ions by studying monomer
              folding and subsequent aggregation upon exposure to alkali
              (monovalent), alkaline earth (divalent) and transition
              (polyvalent) metals. We additionally investigated how CPVT
              (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) mutations
              affect CASQ2 structure and its molecular behaviour when exposed
              to different metal ions. Our results show that alkali and
              alkaline earth metals can initiate similar molecular compaction
              (folding), but only Ca2+ can promote CASQ2 to aggregate,
              suggesting that CASQ2 has a preferential binding to Ca2+ over all
              other metals. We additionally found that transition metals
              (having higher co-ordinated bonding ability than Ca2+) can also
              initiate folding and promote aggregation of CASQ2. These studies
              led us to suggest that folding and formation of higher-order
              structures depends on cationic properties such as co-ordinate
              bonding ability and ionic radius. Among the CPVT mutants studied,
              the L167H mutation disrupts the Ca2+-dependent folding and, when
              folding is achieved by Mn2+, L167H can undergo aggregation in a
              Ca2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, domain III mutants (D307H
              and P308L) lost their selectivity to Ca2+ and could be aggregated
              in the presence of Mg2+. In conclusion, these studies suggest
              that CPVT mutations modify CASQ2 behaviour, including folding,
              aggregation/polymerization and selectivity towards Ca2+.",

              variants alter intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations and if
              cardiac ion channels are affected by it. OBJECTIVE: The goal of
              this study is to test if CASQ2 determines intracellular free
              Ca(2+) concentrations and to identify cardiac ion channels that
              are affected by it. Further, we aim to study disease-associated
              CASQ2 gene variants in this context. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here,
              we study the effects of the CASQ2 mutations R33Q, F189L, and
              D307H, located in highly conserved regions, on the functions of
              cardiac potassium channels in Xenopus oocytes using two electrode
              voltage clamp. As a result, CASQ2 wild type and CASQ2-mutants
              modulated hERG functions differently. Free Ca(2+) measurements
              and molecular dynamics simulations imply alterations in Ca(2+)
              buffer capacity paralled by changes in the dynamic behavior of
              the CASQ2-mutants compared to CASQ2 wild type. CONCLUSIONS: These
              in vitro and in silico data suggest a regulatory role of CASQ2 on
              cytosolic Ca(2+) and hERG channels which may contribute to the
              etiology of CPVT.",

              malignant arrhythmia syndrome linked to mutations in the cardiac
              ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and calsequestrin (CASQ2). RyR2 and
              CASQ2 are parts of the multimolecular Ca(2+) release channel
              complex that is present on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to
              support myocyte Ca(2+) cycling and contractile activity. Whereas
              RyR2 operates as a Ca(2+) release channel, the SR Ca(2+) binding
              protein CASQ2 plays a dual role by serving as a SR Ca(2+) buffer
              and by regulating RyR2 function. Essential to stable Ca(2+)
              cycling, SR luminal Ca(2+)-dependent control of RyR2 activity by

              is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type
              2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations. To define how
              CASQ2 mutations cause CPVT, we produced and studied mice carrying
              a human D307H missense mutation (CASQ(307/307)) or a CASQ2-null
              mutation (CASQ(DeltaE9/DeltaE9)). Both CASQ2 mutations caused
              identical consequences. Young mutant mice had structurally normal
              hearts but stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias; aging produced
              cardiac hypertrophy and reduced contractile function. Mutant
              myocytes had reduced CASQ2 and increased calreticulin and RyR2
              (with normal phosphorylated proportions) but unchanged calstabin
              levels, as well as reduced total sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
              Ca(2+), prolonged Ca(2+) release, and delayed Ca(2+) reuptake.
              Stress further diminished Ca(2+) transients, elevated cytosolic
              Ca(2+), and triggered frequent, spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release.
              Treatment with Mg(2+), a RyR2 inhibitor, normalized myocyte
              Ca(2+) cycling and decreased CPVT in mutant mice, indicating RyR2
              dysfunction was critical to mutant CASQ2 pathophysiology. We
              conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as
              null alleles. In the absence of CASQ2, calreticulin, a fetal
              Ca(2+)-binding protein normally downregulated at birth, remains a
              prominent SR component. Adaptive changes to CASQ2 deficiency
              (increased posttranscriptional expression of calreticulin and
              RyR2) maintained electrical-mechanical coupling, but increased
              RyR2 leakiness, a paradoxical response further exacerbated by
              stress. The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency
              unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to
              RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for

              this study, Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin was assessed
              directly by equilibrium dialysis and correlated with effects on
              protein conformation and calsequestrin's ability to interact with
              other SR proteins. Cardiac calsequestrin bound 800-900 nmol of
              Ca2+/mg of protein (35-40 mol of Ca2+/mol of calsequestrin).
              Associated with Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin was a loss
              in protein hydrophobicity, as revealed with use of absorbance
              difference spectroscopy, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, and
              photoaffinity labeling with the hydrophobic probe
              3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125]iodophenyl)diazirine. Ca2+ binding
              to cardiac calsequestrin also caused a large change in its
              hydrodynamic character, almost doubling the sedimentation
              coefficient. We observed that cardiac calsequestrin was very
              resistant to several proteases after binding Ca2+, consistent
              with a global effect of Ca2+ on protein conformation. Moreover,
              Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin completely prevented its
              interaction with several calsequestrin-binding proteins, which we
              identified in cardiac junctional SR vesicles for the first time.
              The principal calsequestrin-binding protein identified in
              junctional SR vesicles exhibited an apparent Mr of 26,000 in
              sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This 26-kDa

              molecular weight. Our results suggest that the specific
              interaction of calsequestrin with this 26-kDa protein may be
              regulated by Ca2+ concentration in intact cardiac muscle, when
              the Ca2+ concentration inside the junctional SR falls to

              AND RESULTS: In this Bedouin tribe, 9 children (age, 7+/-4 years)
              from 7 related families have died suddenly during the past
              decade, and 12 other children suffered from recurrent syncope and
              seizures starting at the age of 6+/-3 years. Parents of affected
              individuals were asymptomatic and were all related (first-,
              second-, or third-degree cousins). Segregation analysis suggested
              autosomal recessive inheritance. All 12 symptomatic patients and
              1 asymptomatic sibling (mean age, 13+/-7 years) were found to
              have a relative resting bradycardia (64+/-13 bpm, versus 93+/-12
              bpm in the unaffected siblings), as well as PVT induced by
              treadmill or isoproterenol infusion and appearing at a mean sinus
              rate of 110+/-10 bpm. Patients responded favorably to treatment
              with beta-blockers. A genome-wide search using polymorphic DNA
              markers mapped the disease locus to a 16-megabase interval on
              chromosome 1p13-21. A maximal lod score of 8.24 was obtained with
              D1S189 at theta=0.00. Sequencing of KCND3, a gene that encodes an
              I(tO) potassium channel transporter, did not reveal any

              protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). When purified from
              skeletal muscle, CASQ1 is obtained in its glycosylated form.
              Here, we have confirmed the specific site and degree of
              glycosylation of native rabbit CASQ1 and have investigated its
              effect on critical properties of CASQ by comparison with the
              non-glycosylated recombinant form. Based on our comparative
              approach utilizing crystal structures, Ca(2+) binding capacities,
              analytical ultracentrifugation, and light-scattering profiles of
              the native and recombinant rabbit CASQ1, we propose a novel and
              dynamic role for glycosylation in CASQ. CASQ undergoes a unique
              degree of mannose trimming as it is trafficked from the proximal
              endoplasmic reticulum to the SR. The major glycoform of CASQ
              (GlcNAc(2)Man(9)) found in the proximal endoplasmic reticulum can
              severely hinder formation of the back-to-back interface,
              potentially preventing premature Ca(2+)-dependent polymerization
              of CASQ and ensuring its continuous mobility to the SR. Only
              trimmed glycans can stabilize both front-to-front and the
              back-to-back interfaces of CASQ through extensive hydrogen
              bonding and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the mature
              glycoform of CASQ (GlcNAc(2)Man(1-4)) within the SR can be
              retained upon establishing a functional high capacity Ca(2+)
              binding polymer. In addition, based on the high resolution

              unique ER subdomain in the adult myocyte that concentrates
              resident proteins to regulate Ca(2+) release. To investigate
              cellular mechanisms for sorting and trafficking proteins to jSR,
              we overexpressed canine forms of junctin (JCT) or triadin (TRD)
              in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Protein accumulation over time was
              visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy using
              species-specific antibodies. Newly synthesized JCTdog and TRDdog
              appeared by 12-24h as bright fluorescent puncta close to the
              nuclear surface, decreasing in intensity with increasing radial
              distance. With increasing time (24-48h), fluorescent puncta
              appeared at further radial distances from the nuclear surface,
              eventually populating jSR similar to steady-state patterns.
              CSQ2-DsRed, a form of CSQ that polymerizes ectopically in rough
              ER, prevented anterograde traffic of newly made TRDdog and
              JCTdog, demonstrating common pathways of intracellular
              trafficking as well as in situ binding to CSQ2 in juxtanuclear
              rough ER. Reversal of CSQ-DsRed interactions occurred when a form
              of TRDdog was used in which CSQ2-binding sites are removed
              ((del)TRD). With increasing levels of expression, CSQ2-DsRed
              revealed a novel smooth ER network that surrounds nuclei and
              connects the nuclear axis. TRDdog was retained in smooth ER by
              binding to CSQ2-DsRed, but escaped to populate jSR puncta. TRDdog
              and (del)TRD were therefore able to elucidate areas of ER-SR
              transition. High levels of CSQ2-DsRed in the ER led to loss of
              jSR puncta labeling, suggesting a plasticity of ER-SR transition
              sites. We propose a model of ER and SR protein traffic along
              microtubules, with prominent transverse/radial ER trafficking of
              JCT and TRD along Z-lines to populate jSR, and an abundant

              cytoplasm, and the bulk of the molecule, which is highly charged
              and basic, projects into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen.
              Significant homologies were found with triadin and aspartyl
              beta-hydroxylase, suggesting that all three proteins are members
              of a family of single membrane-spanning endoplasmic reticulum
              proteins. Immunocytochemical labeling localized the 26-kDa
              protein to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and
              skeletal muscle. The same gene product was expressed in these two
              tissues. The calsequestrin binding activity of the 26-kDa protein
              combined with its codistribution with calsequestrin and ryanodine
              receptors strongly suggests that the protein plays an important
              role in the organization and/or function of the Ca2+ release
              complex. Because the 26-kDa calsequestrin binding protein is an
              integral component of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum
              membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle, we have named it

              have been postulated to exist in cardiac muscle, but to date none
              has been conclusively identified. Here, we show that only triadin
              1 is significantly expressed. We cloned and sequenced cDNAs
              encoding canine cardiac triadin 1 and 3 but found no evidence for
              triadin 2. From deduced primary structures, antibodies against
              domains common to all triadins and an antibody against the unique
              C terminus of triadin 1 were raised. All antibodies detected two
              prominent proteins of molecular masses 35 and 40 kDa on
              immunoblots from cardiac microsomes, including the antibody that
              recognizes only triadin 1. The 40-kDa mobility form was shown to
              correspond to the glycosylated form of triadin 1, not a distinct
              triadin 2 isoform as previously hypothesized. Confirming this,
              overexpression of triadin 1 in transgenic mouse hearts produced
              both the 35-kDa deglycosylated and the 40-kDa glycosylated
              mobility forms. The glycosylation site of triadin 1 was localized
              to asparagine residue 75, and its bitopic arrangement in the
              membrane was confirmed. Although a 92-kDa immunoreactive protein
              could be tentatively identified in myocardium as triadin 3, its
              expression level was insignificant (</=5\%) compared with that of

              with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin,
              and calsequestrin. To better understand the role of triadin 1 in

              transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to
              mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy
              chain promoter to drive protein expression. The protein was
              overexpressed 5-fold in mouse ventricles, and overexpression was
              accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy. The levels of two other
              junctional SR proteins, the ryanodine receptor and junctin, were
              reduced by 55\% and 73\%, respectively, in association with
              triadin 1 overexpression, whereas the levels of calsequestrin,
              the Ca(2+)-binding protein of junctional SR, and of phospholamban
              and SERCA2a, Ca(2+)-handling proteins of the free SR, were
              unchanged. Cardiac myocytes from triadin 1-overexpressing mice
              exhibited depressed contractility; Ca(2+) transients decayed at a
              slower rate, and cell shortening and relengthening were
              diminished. The extent of depression of cell shortening of
              triadin 1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes was rate-dependent, being
              more depressed under low stimulation frequencies (0.5 Hz), but
              reaching comparable levels at higher frequencies of stimulation
              (5 Hz). Spontaneously beating, isolated work-performing heart
              preparations overexpressing triadin 1 also relaxed at a slower
              rate than control hearts, and failed to adapt to increased
              afterload appropriately. The fast time inactivation constant,
              tau(1), of the l-type Ca(2+) channel was prolonged in transgenic
              cardiomyocytes. Our results provide evidence for the coordinated
              regulation of junctional SR protein expression in heart
              independent of free SR protein expression, and furthermore
              suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the

              (RYR2), which encodes a cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)

              polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The mechanisms
              leading to the clinical phenotype are still poorly understood
              because only 1 CASQ2 mutation has been characterized in vitro.
              METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a homozygous 16-bp deletion at
              position 339 to 354 leading to a frame shift and a stop codon
              after 5aa (CASQ2(G112+5X)) in a child with stress-induced
              ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest. The same deletion was
              also identified in association with a novel point mutation
              (CASQ2(L167H)) in a highly symptomatic CPVT child who is the
              first CPVT patient carrier of compound heterozygous CASQ2
              mutations. We characterized in vitro the properties of CASQ2
              mutants: CASQ2(G112+5X) did not bind Ca2+, whereas CASQ2(L167H)
              had normal calcium-binding properties. When expressed in rat
              myocytes, both mutants decreased the sarcoplasmic reticulum
              Ca2+-storing capacity and reduced the amplitude of I(Ca)-induced
              Ca2+ transients and of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized
              myocytes. Exposure of myocytes to isoproterenol caused the
              development of delayed afterdepolarizations in CASQ2(G112+5X).
              CONCLUSIONS: CASQ2(L167H) and CASQ2(G112+5X) alter CASQ2 function
              in cardiac myocytes, which leads to reduction of active
              sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and calcium content. In
              addition, CASQ2(G112+5X) displays altered calcium-binding
              properties and leads to delayed afterdepolarizations. We conclude
              that the 2 CASQ2 mutations identified in CPVT create distinct
              abnormalities that lead to abnormal intracellular calcium
              regulation, thus facilitating the development of

              female with a structurally normal heart and unexplained syncopal
              episodes. This mutation results in the nonconservative
              substitution of glutamine for arginine at amino acid 33 of CASQ2
              (R33Q). Adenoviral-mediated expression of CASQ2(R33Q) in adult
              rat myocytes led to an increase in excitation-contraction
              coupling gain and to more frequent occurrences of spontaneous
              propagating (Ca2+ waves) and local Ca2+ signals (sparks) with
              respect to control cells expressing wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2WT). As
              revealed by a Ca2+ indicator entrapped inside the sarcoplasmic
              reticulum (SR) of permeabilized myocytes, the increased
              occurrence of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks and waves was associated
              with a dramatic decrease in intra-SR [Ca2+]. Recombinant CASQ2WT
              and CASQ2R33Q exhibited similar Ca(2+)-binding capacities in
              vitro; however, the mutant protein lacked the ability of its WT
              counterpart to inhibit RyR2 activity at low luminal [Ca2+] in
              planar lipid bilayers. We conclude that the R33Q mutation
              disrupts interactions of CASQ2 with the RyR2 channel complex and
              impairs regulation of RyR2 by luminal Ca2+. These results show
              that intracellular Ca2+ cycling in normal heart relies on an
              intricate interplay of CASQ2 with the proteins of the RyR2
              channel complex and that disruption of these interactions can
              lead to cardiac arrhythmia.",

              the first nonsense mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin gene,
              CASQ2, in three CPVT families. The three mutations, a nonsense
              R33X, a splicing 532+1 G>A, and a 1-bp deletion, 62delA, are
              thought to induce premature stop codons. Two patients who
              experienced syncopes before the age of 7 years were homozygous
              carriers, suggesting a complete absence of calsequestrin 2. One
              patient was heterozygous for the stop codon and experienced
              syncopes from the age of 11 years. Despite the different
              mutations, there is little phenotypic variation of CPVT for the
              CASQ2 mutations. Of the 16 heterozygous carriers of these various
              mutations, 14 were devoid of clinical symptoms or ECG anomalies,

              wild-type form of CASQ2 (CSQ(WT)) by expression in eukaryotic
              cell lines and neonatal mouse myocytes. The mutation created an
              additional N-glycosylation site resulting in a higher molecular
              weight form of the recombinant protein on immunoblots. The
              mutation reduced the Ca(2+) binding capacity of the protein and
              exhibited an altered aggregation state. Consistently,
              CSQ(K206N)-expressing myocytes exhibited an impaired response to

              activation of cardiac contraction. RyR2 functional activity is
              governed by changes in [Ca(2+)] on both the cytosolic and luminal
              phase of the RyR2 channel. Activation of RyR2 by cytosolic Ca(2+)
              results in Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) from the SR. The
              decline in luminal [Ca(2+)] following release contributes to
              termination of CICR and Ca(2+) signalling refractoriness through
              the process of luminal Ca(2+)-dependent deactivation of RyR2s.
              The control of RyR2s by luminal Ca(2+) involves coordinated

              fractions in that it contains a substantial amount of junctional
              face membrane (JFM) (15-20\% of the membrane) with
              morphologically well-defined junctional feet structures. In

              predominantly the calcium pump membrane (80-85\% of the membrane)
              and compartmental contents (CC), consisting mainly of
              calcium-binding protein (calsequestrin). In this study, a
              modified procedure for the preparation of JTC from frozen rabbit
              back muscle is described. The yield is substantially greater
              (threefold per weight of muscle), yet retaining characteristics
              similar to JTC from fresh hind leg muscles. Methodology has been
              developed for the disassembly of the JTC. This is achieved by
              selectively extracting the calcium pump membrane with 0.5\%
              Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 to yield a complex of
              JFM with CC. The CC are then solubilized in the presence of EDTA
              to yield JFM. This fraction contains unidirectionally aligned
              junctional feet structures protruding from the cytoplasmic face
              of the membrane with repeat spacings comparable to that observed
              in JTC. The JFM contains 0.16 mumol phosphorus (lipid) per
              milligram protein. Characteristic proteins include 340 and 79-kD
              bands, a doublet at 28 kD, and a component that migrates somewhat
              slower than or equivalent to the calcium pump protein.
              Approximately 10\% of the calcium-binding protein remains bound
              to the JFM after EDTA extraction, indicating the presence of a
              specific binding component in the JFM. The JFM, which is involved
              in junctional association with transverse tubule and likely in
              the Ca2+ release process in excitation-contraction coupling, is

              (CPVT) is a lethal inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterised by
              adrenergically stimulated ventricular tachycardia. Mutations in
              the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RYR2) cause an autosomal
              dominant form of CPVT whilst mutations in the cardiac
              calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) cause an autosomal recessive form.
              OBJECTIVES: Clinical and genetic evaluation of a large family
              with severe autosomal dominant CPVT. METHODS: Clinical evaluation
              of family members was performed, including detailed history,
              physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and exercise stress
              test (EST), and autopsy review in decedents. We performed
              genome-wide linkage analysis on 12 family members and exome
              sequencing on two affected family members. In silico models of
              mouse and rabbit myocyte electrophysiology were used to predict
              potential disease mechanisms. RESULTS: Severe CPVT with dominant
              inheritance in six members was diagnosed in a large family with
              two sudden deaths, two resuscitated cardiac arrests (RCAs) and
              multiple appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
              shocks. Comprehensive analysis of cardiac arrhythmia genes did
              not reveal a pathogenic variant. Exome sequencing identified a
              novel heterozygous missense variant in CASQ2 (Lys180Arg)
              affecting a highly conserved residue, which cosegregated with
              disease and was absent in unaffected family members. Genome-wide
              linkage analysis confirmed a single linkage peak at the CASQ2
              locus (LOD score=3.01, $\vartheta$=0). Computer simulations
              predicted that haploinsufficiency was unlikely to cause the
              severe CPVT phenotype and suggested a dominant negative
              mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time a variant in
              CASQ2 causes autosomal dominant CPVT. Genetic testing in dominant
              CPVT should include screening for heterozygous CASQ2 variants.",

              catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)
              implies a crucial role for the N terminus. In this study, we
              demonstrate that this mutation resides in a highly conserved
              alternately charged residue cluster (DGKDR; cluster 1) in the

              cluster configures itself as a ring system and that the dipolar
              arrangement within the cluster brings about a critical
              conformational flip of Lys(31)-Asp(32) essential for dimer

              In order to understand the molecular mechanism and
              pathophysiological link between these CPVT-related missense
              mutations of hCSQ2 and the resulting arrhythmias, we generated
              three CPVT-causing mutants of hCSQ2 (R33Q, L167H, and D307H) and
              two non-pathological mutants (T66A and V76M) and investigated the
              effect of these mutations. In addition, we determined the crystal
              structure of the corresponding wild-type hCSQ2 to gain insight
              into the structural effects of those mutations. Our data show
              clearly that all three CPVT-related mutations lead to significant
              reduction in Ca2+-binding capacity in spite of the similarity of
              their secondary structures to that of the wild-type hCSQ2.
              Light-scattering experiments indicate that the Ca2+-dependent
              monomer-polymer transitions of the mutants are quite different,
              confirming that the linear polymerization behavior of CSQ is
              linked directly to its high-capacity Ca2+ binding. R33Q and D307H
              mutations result in a monomer that appears to be unable to form a
              properly oriented dimer. On the other hand, the L167H mutant has
              a disrupted hydrophobic core in domain II, resulting in high
              molecular aggregates, which cannot respond to Ca2+. Although one
              of the non-pathological mutants, T66A, shares characteristics
              with the wild-type, the other null mutant, V76M, shows

              wide variety of functions ranging from gene expression, motility,
              and secretion to tissue and organ development and the immune
              response. SOCs are activated by the depletion of Ca(2+) from the
              endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggered physiologically through
              stimulation of a diverse set of surface receptors. Over 15 years
              after the first characterization of SOCs through
              electrophysiology, the identification of the STIM proteins as ER
              Ca(2+) sensors and the Orai proteins as store-operated channels
              has enabled rapid progress in understanding the unique mechanism
              of store-operate calcium entry (SOCE). Depletion of Ca(2+) from

  author   = "Royer, Leandro and Ríos, Eduardo",
  abstract = "Since its discovery in 1971, calsequestrin has been recognized as
              the main Ca(2+) binding protein inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum
              (SR), the organelle that stores and upon demand mobilizes Ca(2+)
              for contractile activation of muscle. This article reviews the
              potential roles of calsequestrin in excitation-contraction
              coupling of skeletal muscle. It first considers the quantitative
              demands for a structure that binds Ca(2+) inside the SR in view
              of the amounts of the ion that must be mobilized to elicit muscle
              contraction. It briefly discusses existing evidence, largely
              gathered in cardiac muscle, of two roles for calsequestrin: as
              Ca(2+) reservoir and as modulator of the activity of Ca(2+)
              release channels, and then considers the results of an incipient
              body of work that manipulates the cellular endowment of
              calsequestrin. The observations include evidence that both the
              Ca(2+) buffering capacity of calsequestrin in solution and that
              of the SR in intact cells decay as the free Ca(2+) concentration
              is lowered. Together with puzzling observations of increase of
              Ca(2+) inside the SR, in cells or vesicular fractions, upon
              activation of Ca(2+) release, this is interpreted as evidence
              that the Ca(2+) buffering in the SR is non-linear, and is
              optimized for support of Ca(2+) release at the physiological
              levels of SR Ca(2+) concentration. Such non-linearity of
              buffering is qualitatively explained by a speculation that puts
              together ideas first proposed by others. The speculation pictures
              calsequestrin polymers as 'wires' that both bind Ca(2+) and
              efficiently deliver it near the release channels. In spite of the
              kinetic changes, the functional studies reveal that cells devoid
              of calsequestrin are still capable of releasing large amounts of
              Ca(2+) into the myoplasm, consistent with the long term viability
              and apparent good health of mice engineered for calsequestrin
              ablation. The experiments therefore suggest that other molecules
              are capable of providing sites for reversible binding of large
              amounts of Ca(2+) inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum.",

              is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by sudden
              cardiac death in children. Drug therapy is still insufficient to
              provide full protection against cardiac arrest, and the use of
              implantable defibrillators in the pediatric population is limited
              by side effects. There is therefore a need to explore the
              curative potential of gene therapy for this disease. We
              investigated the efficacy and durability of viral gene transfer
              of the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) wild-type gene in a
              catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia knock-in
              mouse model carrying the CASQ2(R33Q/R33Q) (R33Q) mutation.
              METHODS AND RESULTS: We engineered an adeno-associated viral
              vector serotype 9 (AAV9) containing cDNA of CASQ2 wild-type
              (AAV9-CASQ2) plus the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene to
              infect newborn R33Q mice studied by in vivo and in vitro
              protocols at 6, 9, and 12 months to investigate the ability of
              the infection to prevent the disease and adult R33Q mice studied
              after 2 months to assess whether the AAV9-CASQ2 delivery could
              revert the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
              phenotype. In both protocols, we observed the restoration of
              physiological expression and interaction of CASQ2, junctin, and
              triadin; the rescue of electrophysiological and ultrastructural
              abnormalities in calcium release units present in R33Q mice; and
              the lack of life-threatening arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
              demonstrate that viral gene transfer of wild-type CASQ2 into the
              heart of R33Q mice prevents and reverts severe manifestations of
              catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and that
              this curative effect lasts for 1 year after a single injection of

              unaffected by changes in luminal free [Ca(2+)] (from 0.1 to 1
              mM). The inhibition exerted by CASQ2(WT) association with the
              RyR2 determined a reduction in cytosolic Ca(2+) activation
              sensitivity. RyR2s from KO mice were significantly more sensitive
              to cytosolic Ca(2+) activation and had significantly longer mean
              open times than RyR2s from WT mice. Sensitivity of RyR2s from KI
              mice was in between that of RyR2 channels from KO and WT mice.
              Enhanced cytosolic RyR2 Ca(2+) sensitivity and longer RyR2 open
              times likely explain the CPVT-like phenotype of both KO and KI
              mice.",
