  abstract = "phenix.refine is a program within the PHENIX package that
              supports crystallographic structure refinement against
              experimental data with a wide range of upper resolution limits
              using a large repertoire of model parameterizations. It has
              several automation features and is also highly flexible. Several
              hundred parameters enable extensive customizations for complex
              use cases. Multiple user-defined refinement strategies can be
              applied to specific parts of the model in a single refinement
              run. An intuitive graphical user interface is available to guide
              novice users and to assist advanced users in managing refinement
              projects. X-ray or neutron diffraction data can be used
              separately or jointly in refinement. phenix.refine is tightly
              integrated into the PHENIX suite, where it serves as a critical
              component in automated model building, final structure
              refinement, structure validation and deposition to the wwPDB.
              This paper presents an overview of the major phenix.refine
              features, with extensive literature references for readers
              interested in more detailed discussions of the methods.",
