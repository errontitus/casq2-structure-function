@ARTICLE{Lebedev2014-po,
  title    = "Space-group and origin ambiguity in macromolecular structures
              with pseudo-symmetry and its treatment with the program Zanuda",
  author   = "Lebedev, Andrey A and Isupov, Michail N",
  abstract = "The presence of pseudo-symmetry in a macromolecular crystal and
              its interplay with twinning may lead to an incorrect space-group
              (SG) assignment. Moreover, if the pseudo-symmetry is very close
              to an exact crystallographic symmetry, the structure can be
              solved and partially refined in the wrong SG. Typically, in such
              incorrectly determined structures all or some of the
              pseudo-symmetry operations are, in effect, taken for
              crystallographic symmetry operations and vice versa. A mistake
              only becomes apparent when the R(free) ceases to decrease below
              0.39 and further model rebuilding and refinement cannot improve
              the refinement statistics. If pseudo-symmetry includes
              pseudo-translation, the uncertainty in SG assignment may be
              associated with an incorrect choice of origin, as demonstrated by
              the series of examples provided here. The program Zanuda
              presented in this article was developed for the automation of SG
              validation. Zanuda runs a series of refinements in SGs compatible
              with the observed unit-cell parameters and chooses the model with
              the highest symmetry SG from a subset of models that have the
              best refinement statistics.",

              interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and
              graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice
              users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks
              are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements
              (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls).
              Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert
              users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an
              extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid
              development, but has already achieved very widespread use within
              the crystallographic community. The current state of the software

              by both molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods.
              The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been
              developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics.
              For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be
              significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating
              correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous
              dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which
              account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better
              phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given
              by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and
              anomalous differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of
              Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To
              this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from
