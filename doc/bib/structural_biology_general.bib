  abstract = "The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) software was
              developed to solve the equations of continuum electrostatics for
              large biomolecular assemblages that have provided impact in the
              study of a broad range of chemical, biological, and biomedical
              applications. APBS addresses the three key technology challenges
              for understanding solvation and electrostatics in biomedical
              applications: accurate and efficient models for biomolecular
              solvation and electrostatics, robust and scalable software for
              applying those theories to biomolecular systems, and mechanisms
              for sharing and analyzing biomolecular electrostatics data in the
              scientific community. To address new research applications and
              advancing computational capabilities, we have continually updated
              APBS and its suite of accompanying software since its release in
              2001. In this article, we discuss the models and capabilities
              that have recently been implemented within the APBS software
              package including a Poisson-Boltzmann analytical and a
              semi-analytical solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a
              geometry-based geometric flow solvation model, a graph
              theory-based algorithm for determining pKa values, and an
              improved web-based visualization tool for viewing electrostatics.",

              {Poisson-Boltzmann} electrostatics calculations",

  abstract = "Continuum solvation models, such as Poisson-Boltzmann and
              Generalized Born methods, have become increasingly popular tools
              for investigating the influence of electrostatics on biomolecular
              structure, energetics and dynamics. However, the use of such
              methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as
              force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii.
              Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum electrostatics
              calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates
              to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the
              assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address
              this problem, we have developed the PDB2PQR web service
              (http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/). This server automates many of
              the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum
              electrostatics calculations, including adding a limited number of
              missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating
              titration states and protonating biomolecules in a manner
              consistent with favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and
              radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally
              generating 'PQR' output compatible with several popular
              computational biology packages. This service is intended to
              facilitate the setup and execution of electrostatics calculations
              for both experts and non-experts and thereby broaden the
              accessibility to the biological community of continuum
              electrostatics analyses of biomolecular systems.",

@ARTICLE{Ho2008-og,
  title    = "{HOLLOW}: generating accurate representations of channel and
              interior surfaces in molecular structures",
  author   = "Ho, Bosco K and Gruswitz, Franz",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An accurate rendering of interior surfaces can
              facilitate the analysis of mechanisms at atomic-level detail,
              such as the transport of substrates in the ammonia channel. In
              molecular viewers, one must remove the exterior surface that
              obscures the channel surface by clipping the viewing plane or
              manually selecting the channel residues in order to display a
              partial surface. Neither method is entirely satisfactory, as
              unwanted additional pieces of surfaces are always generated.
              RESULTS: To cleanly visualize a channel surface, we present
              HOLLOW, a program that generates a ``casting'' of the interior
              volume of the protein as dummy atoms. We show that the molecular
              surface of the dummy atoms closely approximates the channel
              surface, where this complementary surface of the protein channel
              can be displayed without superfluous surfaces. CONCLUSION: The
              use of HOLLOW significantly simplifies the generation of channel
              surfaces, and other interior surfaces of protein structures.
              HOLLOW is written in PYTHON and is available at
              http://hollow.sourceforge.net.",
