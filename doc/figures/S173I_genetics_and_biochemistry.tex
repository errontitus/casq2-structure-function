    % What we would like to do here is incorporate the tex for the pedigree directly instead of using a standalone PDF.

    % But it is not easy to get PSTricks to do this, since it wants to write eps.
    % Complex workarounds are possible, but the appropriate solution is probably a different pedigree drawing package (tikz-based) altogether.
    % For now, just incorporate a standalone PDF.

\caption[Dominant cardiac calsequestrin disease mutations]{\textbf{\headingsubsectionone}. \figurepanelcaptiona Pedigree of a large extended family with the S173I mutation and a CPVT-like phenotype. CABG = coronary artery bypass graft; CAD = coronary artery disease; CHD = congenital heart disease; ETT = exercise treadmill test; MI = myocardial infarction; SCD = sudden cardiac death; SIDS = sudden infant death syndrome. \figurepanelcaptionb Multimerization kinetics of the S173I mutant observed using a turbidity assay after addition of \SI{1}{\milli\Molar} \ch{CaCl2} to purified protein (pH 7.4, \SI{20}{\milli\Molar} NaCl, \SI{85}{\milli\Molar} KCl). \figurepanelcaptionc Multimerization kinetics of the K180R mutant observed using a turbidity assay (same conditions as in \textbf{b}). \figurepanelcaptiond Multimerization kinetics of the K180R mutant observed using a turbidity assay (same conditions as in B, but with \SI{2}{\milli\Molar} \ch{MgCl2} added prior to calcium).}
