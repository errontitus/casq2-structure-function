\section*{Data Availability}
The structures determined as part of this work are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under identifiers 6OWV (native) and 6OWW (ytterbium-soaked). The raw diffraction dataset for the native structure is deposited in Zenodo under \doi{10.5281/zenodo.2941360}. The raw diffraction dataset for the ytterbium-complexed structure is likewise deposited in Zenodo under \doi{10.5281/zenodo.2943248}. Source data for plots, as well as all other data presented in the manuscript, are freely available at \url{https://github.com/errontitus/casq2-structure-function}.

\section*{Code Availability}
Code to generate all results and figures from the manuscript is freely available at \url{https://github.com/errontitus/casq2-structure-function}. The manuscript and all figure layouts were constructed entirely in \LaTeX{} using PGF/Ti\textit{k}Z.
