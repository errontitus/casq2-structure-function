# I don't use the pymol script, because it produces odd shading in its colorbars.
# See https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Spectrumbar

# There are some better color bars here, and I used some of these, but the options are limitd. Most notably, blue-white-red is missing.

# Therefore, I mostly use the matplotlib color bars instead.
