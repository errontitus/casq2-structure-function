# There was a problem on deposition where the number of reflections refined against was 57597, which is greater than the total number of reflections used for overall statistics, which is 29912. The discrepancy is due to anomalous pairs. Odd that the PDB sees this as an error. I corrected this by making the refined reflections number 29777 (from the PDB header, the number of non-anomalous reflections used in refinement).
